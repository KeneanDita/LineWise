# LineWise 

A minimalist, from-scratch implementation of Linear Regression in Python, designed to make the fundamentals of machine learning crystal clear.


* Pure Python, no external machine learning libraries required.
* Used 2 datasets and 2 notebooks separately.
* R2 error checker.
* Cross check with Scikit learn Models

## Results

Not so disappointing
 - R2 score =  0.872329 for Medal_Regressor
