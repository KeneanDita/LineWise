# LineWise 

A minimalist, from-scratch implementation of Linear Regression in Python, designed to make the fundamentals of machine learning crystal clear.


* Pure Python, no external machine learning libraries required.
* Used a test data to build the regrerssor and the coeficients.
* R2 error checker.
* Cross check with Scikit learn Model
